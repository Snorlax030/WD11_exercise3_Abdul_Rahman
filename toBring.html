                <br> Packing can be the bane of your life: but we’ve made the chore a little less tiresome for you and devised a COMPLETE packing list. Got a big trip coming up? Use this ultimate guide to remind you of useful essentials you need to buy for your travels whether it’s shower gel, socks, clothes or sunnies. Knowing how to pack a backpack for a long trip ain’t easy. But simply treat this as a packing checklist and tick off each item as you go. Of course, it really depends on what kind of trip you’re about to embark so we’ve tried to include items that cater to every kind of trip! <br>

                <br> When it comes to packing, the best way to pack a backpack is to save space. Our top tip is to fold your clothes efficiently. Remember: Heavy stuff at the bottom, stuff that leaks goes in plastic bags and things you’ll need as soon as you arrive at your destination (like toiletries) at the top. Roll your clothes up rather than fold them if it takes up less room. This guide will also work for suitcases for air travel too, not just backpacks. Don’t forget anything - and happy travelling! <br>

                <br> Here are the other things to bring on your tip to this destinations: <br>

                <br> You can bring your action camera for the river ride and attach the monopod on your lifevest via a metal clasp. Ours was provided by our organizer. That saying, you can only use your action camera when navigating through calm portions of the river, not on rapids. You can also bring a regular (DSLR or mirrorless) camera and secure it in a dry bag, but remember that any items that fall down the river is difficult to retrieve — you might as well consider them gone. <br>
                
               <br> Don’t forget to bring water and snacks because you may get hungry after the activity.
